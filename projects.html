	<p> Yeah they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
		They wishin' on me, yuh
	</p>

	<p> I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
		Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
		Don’t pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
		You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
		I don’t wanna die for them to miss me
		Yes I see the things that they wishin' on me
		Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
		They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me
	</p>

	<p> God's plan, God's plan
		I hold back, sometimes I won't, yuh
		I feel good, sometimes I don't, ay, don't
		I finessed down Weston Road, ay, 'nessed
		Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait
		I go hard on Southside G, yuh, wait
		I make sure that north-side eat
		And still

	<p>	Bad things
		It's a lot of bad things
		That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
		They wishin' on me
	</p>
